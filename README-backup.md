  <p><i>POV: Your code's about to go absolutely feral</i></p>

## ⚡️ What's the Tea?

Listen bestie, this isn't your vanilla prompt library. We've cooked up something that's actually giving main character energy:

- A frontend that's got more drip than your ex's apology texts
- A backend that's built different (the golang girlies ate with this one)
- A prompt management system so clean it's got the minimalists shook

## 🔥 Features That Hit Different

- Prompt storage smoother than that one guy's rizz at the coffee shop
- A frontend-bro that's living rent free in every dev's head
- Backend looking real sigma with that golang energy
- Database framework that said "mid? I don't know her"

## 👀 How to Pull Up

```bash
# Slide into the frontend (respectfully)
cd prompt-library/frontend-bro
npm install    # securing the dependencies bag
npm run dev    # letting it cook

# Time to wake up the backend
cd prompt-library/backend
go mod download    # grabbing the squad
go run main.go     # it's giving server vibes
```

## 🌟 Stack Check (and it's stacked fr)

- Next.js 13+ (she's in her reputation era)
- Golang (caught in 4k being efficient)
- Ent Framework (the database framework equivalent of touching grass)
- Tailwind CSS (making styling less cheugy since forever)

## 💁‍♀️ Wanna Help? (This Could Be Your Villain Arc)

1. Fork it like it's hot
2. Create your branch: `git checkout -b feature/something-fire`
3. Drop that heat: `git commit -m 'added that good good'`
4. Push it real good: `git push origin feature/something-fire`
5. Pull request? More like pull up request
