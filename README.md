## ⚡️ What's the tea?

bestie, this is THE prompt library that's gonna make your coding game absolutely bussin'. no cap, we're talking:

- frontend that slaps harder than your spotify playlist 🎵
- backend that's lowkey carrying the whole squad 💪
- prompts management that's giving main character energy ✨

## 🔥 Features that hit different

- store & manage prompts like they're your precious tiktok drafts
- frontend-bro that's serving looks with that next.js drip
- backend going crazy with that golang energy
- ent framework doing the most for our database game

## 👀 How to pull up

```bash
# yeet yourself into the frontend
cd prompt-library/frontend-bro
npm install
npm run dev

# slay the backend
cd prompt-library/backend
go mod download
go run main.go
```

## 🌟 Stack check (real ones know)

- Frontend: Next.js (13+) because we're not basic
- Backend: Golang because we're built different
- Database: Whatever ent framework is vibing with
- Styling: Tailwind CSS because we understood the assignment
